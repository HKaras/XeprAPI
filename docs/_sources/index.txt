About XeprAPI for Python
========================

The **XeprAPI for Python** provides script driven control and operation of the **Xepr** application
by Bruker BioSpin, it is implemented as a module to be imported by the Python interpreter.

Features
--------

    * **XeprAPI for Python** complements the scripting capabilities provided by the **ProDeL** language with an
      object-oriented approach
    * **Xepr's** datasets, experiments and parameters are represented by Python objects
    * **XeprAPI for Python** provides concurrent scripting, i.e. while a Python script is performing **Xepr**
      operations, **Xepr** can still be controlled interactively by the operator using the **Xepr** GUI.
    * native **Xepr** commands can be run by simply calling methods of a Python class provided by **XeprAPI for Python**
    * the Python interpreter runs as a standalone process, thus it can be used with any third-party module
      available for Python
