Script Keywords
===============

Certain keywords might be added to the first two lines of an XeprAPI script to be run from Xepr
(via the menu item "Run XeprAPI Script"). In general, the actual keywords are all uppercase letters
and they are enclosed in '#' characters (without any spaces). Valid keywords are:

    * **#NOTERM#** -- do not open the script in a terminal window. No window will show up unless
      it is explicitly created by the script (e.g. by way of the *Tkinter* module or any other GUI toolkit).

    * **#NOWAIT#** -- this can be used to control whether the terminal window waits for a key to
      be pressed when the actual script is finished. If the keyword is found, the terminal window
      will not wait before closing. If **#NOTERM#** is also found, the **#NOWAIT#** keyword will be ignored.
